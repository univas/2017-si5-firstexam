        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>
            HTML (an abbreviation for an English language expression HyperText Markup Language, which stands for HyperText Markup Language)
            is a markup language used to construct web pages. HTML documents can be interpreted by browsers. The technology
            is the result of the combination of the HyTime and SGML standards.
        </p>
        <p> HyTime is a standard for structured representation of hypermedia and time-based content. A document is viewed as
            a set of competing time-dependent events (such as audio, video, etc.), linked by hyperlinks. The default is independent
            of other general word processing patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
            SGML iaa standard for formatting texts. It was not developed for hypertext, but it became convenient to turn documents into
            hyper-objects and to describe the links.

        <h3 id="html_history">History</h3>
        <p>
            Tim Berners-Lee (British physicist) created the original HTML (and other associated protocols like HTTP) in a NeXTcube station
            using the NeXTSTEP development environment. At the time language was not a specification, but a collection of
            tools to solve a Tim problem: communication and dissemination of research between him and his group of colleagues.
            His solution, combined with the then emerging public Internet (which would become the Internet) gained worldwide
            attention.
        </p>
        <p>
            Early versions of HTML were defined with flexible syntax rules, which helped those unfamiliar with Web publishing. Over time,
            the use of HTML authoring tools has increased, as has the tendency to make syntax increasingly rigid . Despite
            this, for historical reasons (backwards compatibility), browsers still today can interpret web pages that are
            far from being a valid HTML code.
        </p>

        <h3 id="html_tags">Tags</h3>
        <p>
            Every HTML document has markers (English: tags), words in angle brackets (chevron) ( These markers are the language formatting
            commands. An element is made up of a tag name, attributes, values, and children (which can be other elements
            or text). The attributes modify the default results of the elements and the values characterize this change.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is necessary because the markers serve to define the formatting of a portion of the document, and so we mark where the
            content that will receive the required, specific formatting or marking begins and ends. Some elements are called
            "empty" because they do not mark a text region, they only insert some element in the document. Each element has
            its possible attributes and its values. An example is the href attribute that can be used with the element a,
            with the link but that can not be used with the meta element. This means that we must know exactly what attributes
            and possible values ​​are for each element. In general, HTML is a powerful feature, being a very simple and accessible
            markup language for the production and sharing of documents, images, videos and audio via streaming. In its latest
            version, HTML5, you can create custom bookmarks with JavaScript, a programming language directly compatible with
            HTML. Each tag can have a specific function using a different API (Application Programming Interface), as well
            as its names and styles.
        </p>

        <h3 id="html_editing">Editing HTML documents</h3>
        <p>
            HTML documents are simple text files that can be created and edited in any common text editor, such as the Windows Notepad,
            or TextEdit, of the Macintosh. To facilitate the production of documents, there are specific HTML editors on
            the market with sophisticated features that facilitate repetitive tasks, insertion of objects, elaboration of
            tables and other resources (See list below). Basically they are divided into two types:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Editores de texto fonte: inserem automaticamente os marcadores, orientando a inserção de atributos e marcações</li>
            <li> Editores WYSIWYG: oferecem ambiente de edição com um "esboço" resultado final das marcações</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a simple mechanism for adding style (colors, fonts, spacing etc) to a web document. Instead
            of putting formatting inside the document, CSS creates a link for a page that contains the styles. When you want
            to change the appearance of the portal, you only have to modify one file. With the variation of browser updates
            (browsers) such as Internet Explorer that went without a new version from 2001 to 2006, CSS support may vary.
            Internet Explorer 6, for example, has full CSS1 support and virtually no CSS2 support. More modern browsers like
            Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox have greater support, including CSS3, still in development.

            <li><a href="#css_references">References</a></li>

        </ul>

        <h3 id="css_syntax">Syntax</h3>
        <p>
            CSS has a simple syntax and uses a series of English words to specify the names of different styles of ownership for a page.
            A CSS statement consists of a selector and a statement block. Each statement contains a property and a value,
            separated by a colon (:). Each declaration is separated by a semicolon (;). [3] [4] In CSS, selectors are used
            to declare which markup elements a style applies to, a kind of corresponding expression. The selectors can be
            applied to all the elements of a specific type, or only those elements that correspond to a certain attribute;
            Elements can be combined depending on how they are placed relative to each other in the markup code, or how they
            are nested inside the template document object.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pseudo-class is another form of specification used in CSS to identify markup elements, and in some cases, user-specific actions
            for which a special declaration block applies. A frequently used example is the: hover pseudo-class that applies
            a style only when the user 'points to' the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. This
            is attached to a selector like in a: hover or #elementid: hover. Other pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements are,
            for example: first-line,: visited or: before. A special pseudo-class is: lang (c), "c". A pseudo-class selects
            integer elements, such as: link or: visited, whereas a pseudo-element makes a selection that can consist of partial
            elements, such as: first-line or: first-letter. Selectors can be combined in other ways too, especially in CSS
            2.1, to achieve greater specificity and flexibility.
        </p>



        <h3 id="css_selectors">Selectors</h3>
        <p>
            Style definition is a set of visual properties for an element, CSS defines rules that make style definitions match to an
            element or element group, the document can contain a css block in a style element or using the element link pointing
            To an external file that contains the CSS block.
        </p>
        <p>
            As regras de casamento para o css são chamadas de seletores, uma definição de estilo pode ser casada com um seletor ou um
            grupo de seletores separados por vírgula, um seletor pode casar um elemento por:
            <ul>
                <li>elemento do tipo : element_name { style definition; }</li>
                <li>elemento do tipo com a classe : element_name.class_name { style definition; }</li>
                <li>todos os elementos com a classe : .class_name { style definition; }</li>
                <li>o elemento com o id : #id_of_element { style definition; }</li>
                <li>casamento de um grupo : element_name_01, element_name_02, .class_name { style definition; }</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Javascript</h2>
        <p>
            JavaScript is an interpreted programming language. It was originally implemented as part of web browsers so that scripts
            could be run on the client side and interact with the user without the need for this script to go through the
            server, controlling the browser, performing asynchronous communication and changing the contents of the displayed
            document. It is currently the main language for client-side programming in web browsers. It also starts being
            heavily used on the server side through environments such as node.js. It is designed to be a prototype-based
            object-oriented scripting language, weak and dynamic typing, and first-class functions. It supports functional
            programming and features features such as locks and high order functions commonly unavailable in popular languages
            such as Java and C ++. It is the most widely used programming language in the world. It is based on ECMAScript
            standardized by Ecma international in the specifications ECMA-262 [3] and ISO / IEC 16262.

        </ul>

        <h3 id="js_history">History</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich when working on Netscape under the name Mocha, later had its name changed
            to LiveScript and finally JavaScript. LiveScript was the official name of the language when it was first released
            in the beta version of Netscape 2.0 browser in September 1995 but had its name changed in a joint announcement
            with Sun Microsystems in December 1995 when it was deployed in Netscape browser version 2.0 B3.
        </p>
        <p>
            The change of name from LiveScript to JavaScript coincided with the time when Netscape added support for Java technology
            in its browser (Applets). The final choice of the name caused confusion giving the impression that the language
            was based on java, and that choice was characterized by many as a marketing strategy of Netscape to take advantage
            of the newly released Java.
        </p>

        <h3 id="js_use">Use in web pages</h3>
        <p>
            The primary use of JavaScript is to write functions that are embedded or included in HTML pages and that interact with the
            Document Object Model (DOM) of the page. Some examples of this use are:
            <ul>
                <li>Open a new window (modal) with programmatic control over its size, position and attributes;</li>
                <li>Validate values from a form to ensure that they are acceptable before being sent to the server;</li>
                <li>Images as the mouse moves under them.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            A useful window-based interface feature is a secondary window type ("daughter") of the main screen, or main window, to request
            or display to the user certain supplementary information, similar to "dialog".
